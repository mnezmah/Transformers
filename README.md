## Design

Design in app is very scarce due to long hours inputted to develop the app rather on it's design.
Minimal desing touches have been made with dark blue/grey color combination to keep it eye-friendly. 
Also rounded all of the edges for the same reason. 
Used sans-serif font to get casual feel. 

enjoy creating Transformers :)
